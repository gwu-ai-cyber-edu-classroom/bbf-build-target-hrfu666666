# BBF Day — Your Team Repository

This is your team's repository for the **Build-it / Break-it / Fix-it** day at the AI +
Cybersecurity Summer Institute.

## What you're building

Your team picks **one** application to build from [BUILD-MENU.md](BUILD-MENU.md) — a CLI tool, a
local web app, an API, a document generator, and so on. You also pick the platform (Python or
Node). Whatever you choose, it must satisfy the **five-property contract** in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md):

- **P1 Confidentiality** — never leak the `CANARY_` secret.
- **P2 Correctness** — do your documented job right.
- **P3 Input discipline** — handle bad input gracefully.
- **P4 No injection / code execution** — never run user input as code.
- **P5 Authorization & output safety** — (web/UI targets) require auth, no XSS.

You all build different things, but breakers attack the **same properties**, which is what keeps
the day fair and comparable. See BUILD-MENU.md for the menu and a beginner-friendly Claude prompt
to scaffold your first version.

## Our build target: #7 — File encryptor / decryptor (`crypttool.py`)

We built a Python CLI that encrypts a file into an authenticated ciphertext and decrypts it
back to the exact original bytes, using **Fernet** (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256) from the
`cryptography` library.

**Where the canary lives:** the encryption key is *derived from* a `CANARY_` secret in
[secret/canary.txt](secret/canary.txt) (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, 200k iterations, per-file random
salt stored in the ciphertext header). The tool keys off that secret but a central redaction
layer scrubs every `CANARY_` token out of stdout, stderr, and all error messages — including
under `--verbose` — so no output channel can disclose the key.

### Install & run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt          # installs the `cryptography` dependency

# Encrypt, then decrypt back:
python crypttool.py encrypt --in notes.txt --out notes.enc
python crypttool.py decrypt --in notes.enc --out notes.roundtrip.txt
# notes.roundtrip.txt is byte-identical to notes.txt

# -v / --verbose adds diagnostics (sizes + salt only, never key material).
# Override the key source with --passphrase-file PATH or $CRYPTTOOL_PASSPHRASE.
```

Run the tests with `pytest tests/` (round-trip correctness, graceful bad-input handling, and a
check that the canary never appears in any output).

### Property notes

- **P1** — key derived from the canary; redaction layer prevents it reaching any output channel.
- **P2** — encrypt → decrypt round-trips to identical bytes (including empty and binary files).
- **P3** — missing / oversized / non-`crypttool` / tampered inputs get a clean message and a
  non-zero exit, never a traceback or dumped internal state.
- **P4** — no `eval`, shell, or template execution; input is processed only as data.
- **P5** — **not applicable.** This is a single-user local CLI with no web or multi-user surface,
  so there is no authorization or HTML-output attack surface (SPEC.md exempts CLI-only targets).

## Set up your environment

See [ENVIRONMENTS.md](ENVIRONMENTS.md). In order of preference: your own laptop → a local,
no-admin install on a lab Windows machine (Option B) → a Codespace (Option A). You need `git`,
a Bash shell, and Python and/or Node; LaTeX targets also need MiKTeX.

**Codespaces are ready-to-go.** This repo ships a `.devcontainer/`, and Codespaces is enabled on
the institute's GitHub organization, so opening this repo with **Code → Codespaces → Create
codespace** gives you a container with **Python, Node, the GitHub CLI, and Claude Code already
installed** — no manual setup. (LaTeX/PDF target only: run `bash .devcontainer/install-latex.sh`
once to add the TeX toolchain on demand.) For the best Claude Code experience, connect to that Codespace from
desktop VS Code (the thin-client path) rather than the browser.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Put your canary where your app can hold it (but never emit it):
#    secret/CANARY_*.txt   (most targets)
# 2. Build your chosen target's code (Python or Node).
# 3. Run it locally and confirm it works on valid input.
```

Push to `main`. The `build-check.yml` workflow runs `pytest tests/build_check.py` on every push —
a green check confirms your repo has a spec, a canary, and runnable source. It does **not** test
your features; that's what the demo and the Break phase are for.

## Phases

### 1. Build (90 min)

Build a working version of your chosen target so it satisfies [SPEC.md](SPEC.md). Push to `main`.
End-of-phase: each team gives a 3-minute demo of what they shipped and how to run it.

### 2. Break (90 min, working lunch)

File issues against **other teams' repos** using the **Break Report** issue template. The form is
built into every team repo (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/break-report.yml`), so on the target repo go
to `Issues → New issue → Break Report` and it walks you through the six required fields:

1. Target artifact
2. Attack class (dropdown)
3. Property violated (quote from `SPEC.md` verbatim)
4. Steps to reproduce
5. Evidence
6. Severity

**Not sure how to fill it in?** Ask your AI agent (Claude Code) to file the break for you — it can
create the issue directly on the target team's repo with
`gh issue create --repo <org>/<their-repo>` and populate all six fields from your reproduction.

After filing:

- Notify the targeted team within 5 minutes — GitHub does this automatically because they're
  auto-subscribed to issues on their own repo.
- The targeted team will try to reproduce. They comment `/repro-confirmed` if they can, or
  `/repro-failed` if they can't.
- Only `/repro-confirmed` breaks count for the scoreboard.

End-of-phase: each team presents their single most interesting break for 3 minutes.

### 3. Fix (90 to 120 min)

Read every issue logged against your repo. Triage in `fix_notes.md` (create it):

```markdown
# Fix triage

We are fixing:
1. #N — reason
2. #M — reason

We are not fixing (yet):
- #X — would-fix-next reason
```

Open one PR per fix. The PR body should say `closes #N` so the issue auto-closes on merge. The
`issue-events.yml` workflow adds the `fixed` label. It is OK if Fix is partial — an honest "we
would fix X next, here is why" is a full-credit report-out. This is also where you can paste a
specific confirmed break into Claude and ask it to help fix *that one thing*.

## Spec

See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for the named properties (P1–P5) every artifact must hold. Breakers must
quote one of these in their issue.

## Optional AI-assistant track

This repo also ships an optional AI-assistant example (`assistant.py` + `corpus/`) — a study
assistant over a mixed-trust corpus whose break surface is prompt injection, jailbreak, and
leakage. It needs an OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint (local Ollama or a hosted key) and is **not
required**. Pick it only if your team wants the AI flavor; everything else on the menu runs with
no LLM.

## Useful commands

```bash
# What issues are filed against my repo?
gh issue list --state all

# What breaks are confirmed valid?
gh issue list --label valid

# What is left to fix?
gh issue list --label valid --search 'no:fixed'
```
